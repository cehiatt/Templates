  					<div class='header2'>2-Year/24,000-Mile<sup>1</sup> CPO Scheduled Maintenance Plan</div>
  						<p>You can feel confident in your decision to buy a Certified Pre-Owned vehicle, long after your purchase. Starting from the delivery of your vehicle, we provide you with our exclusive 2 year/24,000 mile<sup>1</sup> scheduled vehicle maintenance plan - which includes oil and oil filter changes, tire rotations and multipoint vehicle inspections.</p>
  					<div class='header2'>12-Month/12,000-Mile<sup>2</sup> Bumper-to-Bumper Warranty</div>
  						<p>Every Certified Pre-Owned Vehicle comes equipped with a comprehensive 12-Month/12,000-Mile<sup>2</sup> Bumper-to-Bumper Warranty. That's four times better coverage than Chrysler.</p>
  					<div class='header2'>Powertrain Limited Warranty</div>
  						<p>Every Certified Pre-Owned Vehicle from Chevy, Buick or GMC comes with a $0 deductible transferable 5-Year/100,000-Mile3 Powertrain Limited Warranty, with roadside assistance and courtesy transportation. 2013 model year and newer Certified Pre-owned Buick vehicles (purchased as of 6/24/2013) come with an enhanced 6-year/100,000 Mile3 Powertrain Limited Warranty with $0 deductible.</p>
  						<p>We believe in our vehicles and aren't afraid to stand behind them.</p>
  						<p>Transferable to subsequent owners</p>
  						<p>24-Hour Roadside Assistance</p>
  					<div class='header2'>172-Point Vehicle Inspection and Reconditioning Process</div>
  						<p>This is not your regular, every-day used vehicle. Certified status is a name that is earned, and earned only by meeting our strict, factory-set standards. If it doesn't pass, we completely recondition it. Our 172-point vehicle inspection is one of the most comprehensive in the industry — and just one of the differences between a regular used vehicle and a Certified Pre-Owned Vehicle from Chevrolet, Buick or GMC.</p>
  					<div class='header2'>3-Day/150-Mile Satisfaction Guarantee</div>
  						<p>If you're not satisfied with your purchase, simply bring it back to your dealer within the first three days or 150 miles (whichever comes first) to exchange it for a Chevrolet, Buick, Pontiac, GMC or Saturn that fits your needs. No regrets. No doubts. No question about it.</p>
  					<div class='header2'>Vehicle History Report</div>
  						<p>We're proud of — and have confidence in — every vehicle we sell. Which is why all Certified Pre-Owned Vehicles from Chevrolet, Buick or GMC come with a detailed Vehicle History Report. Now you can be sure the vehicle that you're purchasing doesn't have any hidden past problems like major accidents, fires or title issues.</p>
